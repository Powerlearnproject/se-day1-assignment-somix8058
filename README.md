# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methodologies and tools to develop and maintenance of high quality software systems


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Digital computers were invented around 1940s-1950s
-Creation of programming languages such as Fotran and C and software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
-Start of structured programming in the 1970 and agile methodologies in 2000

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements which deals with the user needs and system requirements
-Design which deals with the software architecture and user interface
-Implementation which deals with writing the code and building the software
-Testing which ensures the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements
-Deployment which deals with the release of the software to users
-Maintenance which deals with ongoing support ,updates and enhancements to software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology goes through the software development life cycle chronologicaly from one phase to another flowing like a waterfall like in manufacturing ,construction etc while the Agile methodologies utilizes iterative and incremental approach in software development like in large scale projects where teams are assigned 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer writes and developes code
-Quality Assurance Engineerdesigns test to ensure software quality
-Project Manager oversees planning,execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The IDE provides software suites that provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code (eg Visual Studio, Eclipse) while the VCS are software tools used to track changes in the source code and cordinating work among members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Lack of effective communication
-Lack of prioritization of tasks
-lack of regular reassessment of project goals and objectives
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing tests individual components of a software system
-Integration Testing tests interactions detween components
-System Testing test the whole software system

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the crafting of questions or statement to get accurate feedback from a generative Ai

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Incase of an Image generating Ai
Vague - "Show a class full of Kids"
Changed version-"show a class full of african kids with computers and the teacher in a class"
